### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer based in Edinburgh, Scotland.

### Background

Developing primarily for Android since 2010, focused on finical apps.

Keenly interested in Kotlin Multiplatform in particular, especially modern models when combined with use of Declarative UI frameworks like Compose and SwiftUI. Have also done some compose desktop development.

### Currently working on

Creating some KMP stuff...

Mainly on GitLab but moving stuff over...
